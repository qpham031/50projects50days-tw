# 50 Projects in 50 Days - Tailwind CSS Edition

An implementation of the "50 Projects In 50 Days" challenge using Tailwind CSS.

This repository contains my work on the "50 Projects In 50 Days" course, with the personal challenge of using Tailwind CSS for styling instead of traditional CSS. The original course is a fantastic resource for learning and practicing web development skills, and this project is a way to solidify those skills while also diving deep into the Tailwind CSS framework.
